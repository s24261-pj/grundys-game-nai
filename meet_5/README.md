# Neural networks

This project implements a range of classification systems using neural networks and other machine learning approaches
for various datasets. The tasks include:

1. **Mushroom classification**:
    - Determine whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its features.

2. **Animal recognition**:
    - Identify different animals such as cats, dogs, and birds from images.

3. **Clothing recognition**:
    - Classify types of clothing, including shirts, pants, and shoes, based on images.

4. **Fruit and vegetable recognition**:
    - Recognize and classify various fruits and vegetables from images.
